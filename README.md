# pacostrap-beta
## pacstrap for offline installation(manuel arch installation)

Hello Arch lovers!
> 24 September 2025: README.md updated. Logos license added.

## Compiling
```bash
make --makefile build/Makefile -j$(nproc) 
```
## Usage
```ArchISO
pacostrap # For normal customized second stage
pacostrap --pass=usbmount / -P=U-M # For skipping USB mounting and doing mounting disk with installing packages.
pacostrap --pass=diskmount / -P=D-M # For skipping disk mounting and doing USB mounting with installing packages.
pacostrap --pass=diskmount,usbmount / --pass=usbmount,diskmount / -P=D,U-M / -P=U,D-M # For skipping both USB and disk mounting with doing only installing packages.
```
> Where is --stage / -S argumant?
> Answer is: Because you don't need first stage in archiso.  

## Notes for pass argumants.
- In 2nd stage ---*Skipping disk mounting*---> Disk should be mounted at /mnt and you need to make directory at /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg.
- *Skipping both USB and disk mounting*---> USB should make directory at /usbmnt and mount your USB to there. And disk mounting should be like up above.

## WORKFLOW
**Mounts your USB with installed packages on it at */usbmnt/* ---> Mounts your disk at */mnt* ---> Makes */mnt/var/cache/pacman/* directory ---> Copies your packages to */mnt/var/cache/pacman/* ---> Calls pacstrap to Install your packages ---> Completes offline installation.*


## My New Ideas To Add `pacostrap`
- 1st Making second stage Archinstall compatible.
- 2nd Prepare all the other documents. CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md etc.
- 3rd Make you able to install packages by your own in first stage.
