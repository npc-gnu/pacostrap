# pacostrap-alpha
## pacstrap for offline installation(manuel arch installation)

Hello guys!
I finally developed pacostrap fully but i never tested it. But it should probably work.
And this projects development did not end. Now it uses command instead of system (lot more performance and security.)
And, arguments added! Just one argument for now.


Hey arch developers! If you see my project, i would be verry happy to add this software in archiso(but i still need to test it).

## Installation
```any linux shell
chmod +x compile && ./compile
```

## Usage
```any linux shell
sudo pacostrap --stage=1 # for first stage
sudo pacostrap --stage=' # for second stage
```
And i should still add more arguments, colors, and more...
