# pacostrap-alpha
## pacstrap for offline installation(manuel arch installation)

Hello guys!
I finally developed pacostrap fully but i never tested it. But it should probably work.
And this projects development did not end. I am writing a function from scratch and this function will be use:
```system``` functions easy syntax and ```fork/exec``` security.

Hey arch developers! If you see my project, i would be verry happy to add this software in archiso(but i still need to test it).

## Installation
```bash
chmod +x compile && ./compile
```

And i should still add more things
