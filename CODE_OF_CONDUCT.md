# Rules
Well, i don't see myself so smart, and has ability to make or change etical rules, so just do what do you want to do. Except like these situtaions:

## 1st: A bit Swearing
- A: FUCK YOUR SOFTWARE!!
- B: ???
- A: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN BY *??* ! THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT WORKING YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOUR BRAIN IS LIKE THE NEUTRONS IN THE NUCLEI OF THE ATOMS THROUGH WHICH THE ELECTRICITY IN YOUR ROOMâ€™S LIGHT BULB 
FLOWS! THEY ARE BOTH ZERO!

This is a bad speaking. Do not talk like this.

Or

## 2nd: Tinder like speaking
- E: Ohh baby you are so hottt ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ
- T: I liked you too you handsome son of a bitch i would lick yuuuu ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ
- E: What is your instagram ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ

This is a code platform. Not a dating app. So go the fuck away from here if you want to have relationships or s*x friends. Go find a dating app or use proton. At least is has got E2EE. 

Except these things, soo long and bad swear words, do anything you want.
And please tell everything detailed. Both at issues and PR's.
