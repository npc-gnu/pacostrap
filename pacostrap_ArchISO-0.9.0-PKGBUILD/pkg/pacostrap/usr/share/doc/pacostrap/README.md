# pacostrap-beta
## pacstrap for offline installation(manuel arch installation)

Hello Arch lovers!
> 20 September 2025: ArchISO_Edition is now at a different branch.

## Installation
```any linux shell
sudo bash build\&setup/scripts\&makefiles/setup.sh # This script will automatically detect if you are root or not, your machine have arch based distro or not and if it is not; then it will download tarball too.
```

## Usage
### Normal
```Any GNU + Linux shell
sudo ./pacostrap --stage=1 / -S=1 # For first stage
 ./pacostrap --stage=2 / -S=2 # For second stage
sudo ./pacostrap -S=1 --pass=format / -P=F  # For first stage and skipping formatting.
sudo ./pacostrap -S=1 --pass=mount / -P=M # For first stage and skipping formatting with mounting.
 ./pacostrap -S=2 --pass=mount / -P=M # For second stage and skipping disk mount.
```
> If you asking, *Why using sudo in first stage but not in the second?*
> Answer is: You will be root in archiso(so in the second stage) but you will probably non-root in normal destkop using.
### You can check here if Arch developers add this software to ArchISO. (For normal usage, you probably wonâ€™t need this.) 
``` Any GNU + Linux shell
pacostrap # For normal customized second stage
pacostrap --pass=usbmount / -P=U-M # For skipping USB mounting and doing mounting disk with installing packages.
pacostrap --pass=diskmount / -P=D-M # For skipping disk mounting and doing USB mounting with installing packages.
pacostrap --pass=diskmount,usbmount / --pass=usbmount,diskmount / -P=D,U-M / -P=U,D-M # For skipping both USB and disk mounting with doing only installing packages.
```
> Where is --stage / -S argumant?
> Answer is: Because you don't need first stage in archiso.  

## NOTES,
#### Second Stage
- At second stage, you need to mount USB at /usbmnt . 
- And you need to enter /usbmnt/pacostrap/ and then you can run pacostrap in second stage.
#### > If you are using skip argumants,
- In 1'st stage ---*skipping format*---> USB needs to be in a FS that Linux can recognize(exFAT, ext4, BTRFS, NTFS(Maybe. Sometimes it needs extra packages.)) ----\
                \-----> USB needs to mounted at /mnt <-----------------------*skipping both format and mounting*---------------------------------------------------/
- In 2'nd stage ---*Skipping disk mounting*---> Disk should be mounted at /mnt and you need to make directory at /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg.

## WORKFLOW
### First Stage:
**Formatting USB as ext4 ---> Mounting USB at */mnt* ---> Makes Directory */mnt/pacostrap* ---> Copies itself to */mnt/pacostrap/* ---> Installing your selected packages to USB  ---> First stage ends.**

### Second Stage
Firstly, you need to make directory at */usbmnt* then mount the USB at */usbmnt*.
You can do these steps by just running these following commands:
```ArchISO
```
Then,
**Mounts your disk at */mnt* ---> Makes */mnt/var/cache/pacman/* directory ---> Copies your packages to */mnt/var/cache/pacman/* ---> Calls pacstrap to Install your packages ---> Completes offline installation.**

## My New Ideas To Add `pacostrap`
- 1st Making second stage Archinstall compatible.
- 2nd Prepare all the other documents. CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md etc.
- 3rd Make you able to install packages by your own in first stage.

## Functions That `pacostrap` Uses
- 1st command - A safe way to execute system commands for UNIX-based/Unix-like OS'ses [link](https://gitlab.com/pigames3/command)
- 2nd animatel - '.' or string animation function [link](https://gitlab.com/pigames3/animatel)
